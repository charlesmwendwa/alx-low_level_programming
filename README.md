# Learning Objectives
<p>At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:</p>

## General

- Why C programming is awesome
- Who invented C
- Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
- What happens when you type `gcc main.c`
- What is an entry point
- What is `main`
- How to print text using `printf`, `puts` and `putchar`
- How to get the size of a specific type using the nary operator `sizeof`
- How to compile using `gcc`
- What is the default program name when compiling with `gcc`
- What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with `betty-style`
- How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
- How does the `main` function influence the return value of the program

# Copyright - Plagiarism

- You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
- You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
- You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
- Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

# Requirements

## C

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
- You are not allowed to use `system`
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`

## Shell Scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`$ wc -l file` should print 2)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`

# More Info

## Betty linter

<p>To run the Betty linter just with command `betty <filename>`:</p>

- Go to the [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) repository
- Clone the [repo](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) to your local machine
- `cd` into the Betty directory
- Install the linter with `sudo ./install.sh`
- `emacs` or `vi` a new file called `betty`, and copy the script below:
```
#!/bin/bash
# Simply a wrapper script to keep you from having to use betty-style
# and betty-doc separately on every item.
# Originally by Tim Britton (@wintermanc3r), multiargument added by
# Larry Madeo (@hillmonkey)

BIN_PATH="/usr/local/bin"
BETTY_STYLE="betty-style"
BETTY_DOC="betty-doc"

if [ "$#" = "0" ]; then
    echo "No arguments passed."
    exit 1
fi

for argument in "$@" ; do
    echo -e "\n========== $argument =========="
    ${BIN_PATH}/${BETTY_STYLE} "$argument"
    ${BIN_PATH}/${BETTY_DOC} "$argument"
done
```
- Once saved, exit file and change permissions to apply to all users with `chmod a+x betty`
- Move the betty file into `/bin/` directory or somewhere else in your `$PATH` with `sudo mv betty /bin/`
- You can now type `betty <filename>` to run the Betty linter!
